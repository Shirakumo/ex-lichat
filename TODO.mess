- Implement markup
- Test shared-identity
- Keep server stats of when IPs connect and with which names, etc.
- Expose these stats through an extra interface.
- Track and limit connections per IP
- Send disconnect when connection process terminates from application shutdown
- Be stricter about image payloads in emotes and especially channel/user-info:
  - Automatically resize icons to fit a predetermined max-size
  - Reject payload if the payload is not an actual png/jpeg/gif file
